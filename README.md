<h1>image filters using cpp</h1>
<p>
  This repository was created by Amr Khaled, Youssef Amgad, and Mohamed Ahmed to apply some magic filters using the CPP language and an external library created by students of FCAI College in Cairo.</p>
<p>The filters in this repository are:</p>
<p>
<ol>
1. Grayscale
2. Black and white filter
3. Reverse the image
4. Merge two images
5. Flip the image
6. Rotate the image
7. Darken and lighten the image
8. Crop the image
9. Add the frame
10. Edge detection
11. Change size
12. Infrared rays
13. Magenta filter
14. Blur the image
15. Sunny filter
16. Upload a new photo
17. Save the image
</ol>
</p>
The program starts with a welcome message, then asks the user to enter the name of the image he wants to upload, then a list of filters appears for the user to choose from
You can apply more than one filter
You can save whatever you want at any time after applying the filter
You can save it in the same file or create a new file
After saving your photo, you can upload a new photo
